              <p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Optimist, <br><br>
              Welcome to International Foundation of Senegalese Twins and their Parents!<br>
              I.F.S.T.P is a 501c3 charitable organization started by a group of Twin Mothers based in New York City who believe in providing all Twin children and their mothers an excellent quality of life.  All contributions are deductible within legal limits.<br><br>
              Discovering that you're having twins can be a shock, and it may mean that your pregnancy is slightly different to what you expected. Of all the types of multiple births, twins normally face the fewest medical problems and complications. Each additional baby a woman carries during her pregnancy increases the possibility of developing pregnancy complications.<br><br>

              Today, we focus on the entire family, especially those Twin families under stress from social, emotional or financial challenges. We have been able to help Parents who have multiple birth babies and are themselves high psycho-social risk families. Coping with the stress of caring for them is one of the biggest challenges any family can face. Divorce and abandonment of the mother and children is common. We do all our best to avoid tragedies of twins’ death while their parents are unable to get them medical treatment and prepare parents to not murder their newborn twins when they are overwhelmed by stress and sleep deprivation from pregnancy to birth of their babies.<br><br>

              We have assisted has assisted more than 200 multiple-birth families by providing infant formula to supplement breast-feeding, disposable diapers, strollers, coats, clothing, baby bottles, blankets, cribs, baby food, Uniform and French books and Sheltering and everything mothers may need but, in most cases, cannot dream of securing for their babies.<br><br>

              For this purpose, we will organize various campaigns: donors’ days, charity concerts, fairs and many other events. Apart from that, we publish all the incoming data about children’s lives on our official website page and social networks, as well as friendly Internet portals and other media resources. We operate in partnership with other funders in both the public and private sector and look for opportunities to provide catalytic support in areas of fundamental concern for underserved children.<br><br>
              I encourage you to browse our website to learn more about International Foundation of Senegalese Twins and their Parents and how we can support you and your family! <a href="contact.html" style="color: blue">Help us to help Others</a><br>
